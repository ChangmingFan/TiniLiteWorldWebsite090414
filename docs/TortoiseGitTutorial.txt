Starting Over From Scratch:

	1. Online: Delete Old Test Repository, then Create New Test Repository
		i.Goto Repository Folder, Click on the Repository
		iii.On Right Menu SETTINGS, Scroll Down To DANGER ZONE
	2. On the Desktop delete Old Test Repository Folder
	3. On the Desktop delete any existing Keys
	4. Create new empty folder then copy into it your project or leave empty 
		Make sure this does not have ".git" anywhere in it.
	5. Begin Tortoise: Pageant, Begin Tortoise: Putty-Key-Generator
	6. Load an existing Private-Key.ppk or generate a new private key and save it.
		Note the location and PASSPHRASE(changming, not github081414). 
		Keep this Private-Key.ppk for future use.

If you already have a private_key:
	7. Add the saved Private-Key.ppk to Pageant. Make sure there are no other keys conflicting.
	8. Let this Pageant stay running in the background even after restarting the computer
	9. Return online to New Test Repository:
	10. In SETTINGS -> SSH -> Add New Key
	11. Copy&Paste the "Public key for pasting into OpenSSH authorized_key" 	
		file from Putty-Key-Generator (still open).
	14. This key must begin and end with "ssh-rsa .... ==rsa-keyDATE" to be sure.
	15. Once Key is Added, Save BOTH the SSH and HTTPS paths.
	15. Notice this Online Key should have the same fingerprint as Putty-Key-Generator.
		e.g. "6d:e4:aa:5e:2f:f4:c1:99:69:ed:74:2b:64:2b:64:e4" 
	16. On the desktopn, open the RIGHT-CLICK menu on your new project folder, view:
				Git Clone...
				Git Create Repository Here...
				Tortoise Git -> Settings
		tip: don't do clone yet.
	17. Now Create the Repository -> select ALL -> Commit these files
		tip: do not immediately select "push", for now just close the window
	18. Again open the RIGHT-CLICK menu on the new project folder, view now:
			Git Synch...
			Git Commit->Master
			TortoiseGit -> MANY CHOICES
	19. Click "Git Synch...", in "Remote URL" paste the SSH or HTTPS paths to the repository you want to update	(tip: make sure there is no Folder Icon in this field?)
		for example:
			git@github.com:ChangmingFan/TiniLiteWorldWebsite090414.git
		or:
			https://github.com/ChangmingFan/TiniLiteWorldWebsite090414.git
